**Definition.** A **cash flow** is a time series of incoming and outgoing money. Thus, a cash flow can be modeled as a finite sequence of real numbers $(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n)$. Different investments can have different cash flows.

Examples:
- $(1, -1.1)$ is a loan with 10% rate settled in one payment
- $(1, -0.1, -0.1, \ldots, -0.1)$ a load settled in periodic payments.

A cash flow is **deterministic** if it's incoming and outgoing values are known *a priori* (e.g., a fixed rate bond). Otherwise, the cash flow is **non-deterministic**.
